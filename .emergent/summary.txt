The AI engineer's work primarily focused on transforming a pre-existing React frontend application to integrate with Supabase for authentication and user management, evolving into a sophisticated hierarchical system. Initial efforts involved understanding the unexpected pure React codebase (instead of a FastAPI/React/MongoDB structure), setting up Supabase connections, and implementing basic login/user profile features. Subsequent iterations addressed numerous bugs, including RLS policy issues, database schema discrepancies (e.g.,  column), frontend rendering problems (blank screen, flickering), and UX improvements (replacing alerts with modals, temporary password handling). The most significant task was a comprehensive redesign of the authentication and user hierarchy (Admin > Team Manager > Broker > Client) with simplified password management. The work concluded amidst resolving flickering during user creation and refining password change flows.

The initial request was to connect a database to the GitHub repository. This evolved significantly into building a Mortgage Tracker Pro application with a robust user management system.

1.  **Initial Database Connection & User Setup:** Connect a database (Supabase, based on existing  files) to the app. Create a power user (admin) with specific credentials (, ) and remove demo messages.
2.  **Login & UI Fixes:** Address issues like a blank white screen, Blocked request due to Vite config, and Invalid login credentials by ensuring database tables exist, fixing RLS policies, and providing clear setup instructions.
3.  **Core Functionality (Bug Fixes & Enhancements):**
    *   Resolve Failed to create client profile error.
    *   Ensure broker contact/company name persistence after logout/login.
    *   Fix dark/bright mode toggle functionality.
    *   Enable admin to remove brokers from the Manage Brokers screen.
    *   Ensure team manager broker deletions are persistent in the database.
    *   Add Add New Broker button for Admin users.
4.  **Authentication & User Management Redesign:**
    *   Implement a hierarchical user structure: Admin > Team Manager > Broker > Client.
    *   No open sign-up; all users created by superiors.
    *   Clients log in via simple password (initially magic link/OTP, later simplified).
    *   Implement access controls: Admin (full access, creates Team Managers), Team Manager (creates Brokers), Broker (creates Client Applications, inputs client details).
    *   Clients have read-only access to their applications.
5.  **Simplified Temporary Password Flow:**
    *   Admin/Team Manager creates users with temporary passwords. Users change password on first login.
    *   Temporary passwords for brokers and clients should be randomly generated and displayed in a textbox within the respective creation forms (Add New Broker, New Application), replacing the previous password popup.
    *   Database cleanup to remove existing users/profiles except admin.
6.  **Persistence and UI Stability:** Ensure created users (brokers, clients) are persistently saved to the database and correctly displayed. Fix UI flickering during user creation and ensure password change prompts dismiss correctly.

<code_architecture>
The application is a single-level React frontend app, directly within the  directory, contrary to the initial expectation of a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB structure.

-   ****: Main application component. Manages global state (user, theme, loading), renders different pages based on authentication state, and contains core data fetching logic.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to use , , , and . Modified  and  to ensure proper user refresh and theme application. Adjusted rendering logic to prevent flickering.
-   ****: Provides authentication state and functions (login, logout, fetch user profile) to the entire app.
    -   *Changes*: Enhanced error handling for database queries, particularly for  table existence. Added  state. Modified  to handle missing profiles. Added  function.
-   ****: Centralized functions for interacting with Supabase, including user authentication and CRUD operations on  and .
    -   *Changes*: Refactored  and  to align with the new user hierarchy and temporary password logic. Added functions for updating broker profiles. Updated user creation to directly insert into  after .
-   ** (renamed to )**: The primary login interface for users.
    -   *Changes*: Removed self-registration UI elements, focusing solely on login. Added error messaging. Replaced with  for cleaner code.
-   ****: Allows Admin/Team Managers to view, edit, add, and delete brokers.
    -   *Changes*: Fixed broker creation (persistence to database). Enabled delete functionality for admins and persistent deletion for team managers. Added Add New Broker button for admin. Integrated the  with the new temporary password field logic.
-   ****: Modal for adding/editing broker details.
    -   *Changes*: Added a randomly generated Temporary Broker Password field to the form. Updated submit handler to pass this password to the  function.
-   ****: (Removed) Previously used to display temporary passwords after user creation.
-   ****: Forces users to change their temporary password on first login.
    -   *Changes*: Added logic to update user password and handle successful/failed updates. Integrated with 's refresh.
-   ****: Vite build configuration.
    -   *Changes*: Added  to include the preview URL, resolving Blocked request errors.
-   ****: Stores Supabase URL and Anon key.
    -   *Changes*: Updated  and  when the user changed Supabase projects.
-   **SQL Scripts ( files in )**: Various scripts for database schema adjustments (creating tables, adding columns, fixing RLS, deleting data, adding admin users).
    -   *Purpose*: These scripts were provided to the user to run directly in the Supabase SQL editor to manage database structure and data, critical for fixing schema-related errors and user setup.

-   Add Temporary Client Password field to the New Application screen for clients.
-   Fix the password change prompt () staying on the screen until manually refreshed.
-   Further address the flickering sign-in page during user creation, related to session restore.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing three main issues identified by the user:
1.  **Flickering Sign-in Page**: When a new user (broker) is created, the application's login page momentarily flickers. The AI engineer believes this is due to the session sign-out/restore mechanism after user creation. The current approach is to optimize this to prevent the login page from showing during this process. The  file is being examined to refine how  and user refreshes are handled, specifically by implementing a  function.
2.  **Missing Client Temporary Password Field**: The New Application screen does not display a temporary password for clients, which is necessary for clients to log in. This needs to be implemented.
3.  **Password Change Prompt Stays on Screen**: After a broker logs in with a temporary password and updates it on the , the prompt remains on the screen until the page is manually refreshed. This indicates an issue with the state update or redirection logic after a successful password change. The AI engineer initially checked  and then moved to  to ensure  properly updates the user profile after a password change.

The most recent action was modifying  to create a proper refresh function () that updates the user profile, aiming to resolve the password change page persistence and potentially the flickering issue. The next immediate step is to fix the flickering by preventing the login page from showing during session restore.
